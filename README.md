# youtube_on_repeat
Challenged myself to replicate http://www.listenonrepeat.com This is my attempt in doing so

ListenOnRepeat is a website that I often use to listen to Youtube videos on loop. I cannot do this on Youtube since usually I only want to watch a portion of the videos on loop (not the entire thing), and ListenOnRepeat allows me to do that by specifying a range of time to loop. However, lately they added unnecessary functionalities such as the ability to like videos, loop playlists, tracking videos you watched, etc. that took away the simplicity of it that I liked. Plus, they also have ads now, which prompted me to make a version of it and use it as a replacement to ListenOnRepeat.

Functionalities:
- Has range of which you can specify the portion of the video to loop
- Has youtube search built in (so you dont have to go to Youtube first, copy the Youtube URL and come back)
- Loop the video endlessly
